# Cursed Morning

Small game about the curse of having to wake up in the morning.
Made during [Godot Wild Jam #54](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-54).


## :warning: Warning

This project is unfinished, and most code was written at 03:00 in the morning.
It was created within the time constraints of a game jam, so the code is neither
complete nor bug free. On the contrary, please expect many unresolved bugs!


## About

The player is sleeping peacefully, dreaming about lands far away. If only there
wasn't the constant ringing of their alarm clock. Half aware of their curse
of having to wake up eventually, they try to stay asleep for just a little longer.

## Mechanics

All interactions are quicktime events. The player mostly moves on predertermined paths.
Sometimes a quick time event can change which path is taken.

The player wakes up if they fail too many quicktime events.
